<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<section>
<p>Our mission is this: change restaurant menus to label which items have dairy and raise awareness about lactose intolerance and dairy allergies in the process. Restaurants play a big role in American society and therefore almost all Americans go to restaurants. This means the people that struggle with lactose intolerance go to restaurants. Most restaurant menus give the main parts of a meal but not all the ingredients with lesser amounts. Therefore, many meals that are not labeled with any lactose filled item may contain lactose from the ingredients not labeled on the menu. This means that the 30 million Americans with a lactose intolerance may be eating lactose even when they think they are not<sup>1</sup>. Even if these Americans notify the server of their allergies, the information may not make it through the information chain to the chef. In conclusion, 30 million Americans are at risk of a reaction every time they go out to a restaurant. 
</p>
<p>We have laid out the issue, now we have to solve it. Our goal is to raise awareness and lactose intolerances to put pressure on restaurants to make the switch to labeling their menus with DF. Our plan has three parts: write letters to big restaurant groups, raise awareness online and in newspapers, and talk to local restaurant owners. The first is to try to make those at the top of the restaurant business aware of the issue and try to create a trickle down solution. The second requires reaching out and talking to others to try to put pressure on restaurants from those they rely on, their customers. The third is a solution that can be done one step at a time, in our communities. By enacting these three solutions, we hope to influence the restaurant industry on all sides. If we can effectively push even two of these solutions we can take a step towards the day when one can go to a restaurant and see two letters on the menu: DF. 
</p>
<p>Imagine a future where 30 million Americans who struggle with lactose intolerances can go out to eat without a care. Without a care that they may spend the night with pain. That is the mission of this organization. Whether you struggle with lactose intolerance yourself, know someone who does, or merely just want to help 30 million Americans when they go out to eat. First, you can support us online (coming soon). Second, you can write letters and talk to local restaurants yourself. Third, you can email us (coming soon) to see how you can get involved further. We hope that someday this organization will start a movement. A movement that will help not only the at least 30 million Americans who struggle with lactose intolerances but the restaurants who are finally more inclusive to a large amount of the American population. That is the mission of our organization.
