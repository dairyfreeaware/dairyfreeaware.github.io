<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>At least 30 million Americans are lactose intolerant<sup>1</sup>. At least 30 million Americans have to watch out for lactose whenever they go out to eat. At least 30 million Americans stare at menus not knowing which options will cause them a stomachache, or worse. Our goal is that when these 30 million Americans go out to eat, their menus tell them which options have lactose. Even in the restaurants who have started to mark their menus with “vegetarian”, “vegan”, and “gluten free”, many still have not added "dairy free". Our goal is merely to add two letters to restaurant menus across the U.S., DF. By doing this, those among us who struggle with lactose intolerances can go out to eat without worrying. Without worrying about those ingredients not mentioned in the menu. Without worrying about an uncomfortable night. Without worrying about the consequences.

<h3>Why We Started This</h3>
<p>We’re twins. We stick out for each other. When we were little, we could both eat whatever we wanted. But, as we grew older, Jacob developed a lactose intolerance, which runs in our family. Our mother, grandmother, and one of our aunts all have developed this allergy. We’re one of many families where lactose intolerance is hereditary. As we’ve gotten older, we’ve noticed a trend, it is hard to avoid lactose at most restaurants. Often, there are hidden ingredients and we don’t know this until too late. We started this to stop hoping and start knowing there isn’t lactose in our meals. We started this to bring awareness about the large number of us who struggle with lactose intolerances every day.  Most Importantly, we started this so future families will know whether or not they should have eaten that dish.
